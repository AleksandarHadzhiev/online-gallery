Project with a goal to learn to use next.js

## General Information 

Next.js application with the idea to use Python in the future as a backend service.

This is a personal exercise application, which has for a goal to use Next.js as frontend and in the future to use Python. The application is using  axios to make the API calls in the frontend and the Pexels API to fetch videos and photos.

The application is still in progress with goals to improve the design of the application, make the design responsive and build a backend API with Python.

## Status

The app is currently only for regular users without sign in and sign up functionalities. The user can look at videos and photos from the Pexels API right of the bat and additionally the user can search for specific things he/she wants to see.

## Future Goals

The goals for the app are to make use of Python for backend API and allow registration of the users. Also, the registrated users will be able to add videos or photos to list of favourites. Additionally, the user will be able to upload personal images to the site, outside of the Pexels API. The images will later on be displayed together with the ones from the Pexels API.
